## Welcome to the Drink Recipe Application's README üçª

### Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive drink recipe application that allows users to manage and explore various drinks. The application encompasses three distinct user groups: Admin Users, API Users, and Guest Users, each with tailored functionalities.

### User Roles and Functionalities

#### Admin Users

Admin users hold the highest level of access and possess the ability to:

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) all entities within the application, including categories, ingredients, glasses, and drinks.
- Upload images for categories, storing them in the server's public directory.
- Edit drink details, including name, description, recipe, categories, ingredients, glasses, and image.
- Manage their profile, including viewing and updating personal information.
- Access all application features through the dashboard.

#### API Users

API users enjoy a unique role, granting them access to the application's API for third-party integration. They can:

- Register and log in to the application.
- Edit their profile, excluding password and email.
- Obtain their API keys upon registration and login.
- Access all read endpoints of the API, utilizing their API keys.

#### Guest Users

Guest users, without the need to register or log in, can:

- Explore a wide range of drink recipes.
- Filter drinks by categories, ingredients, and glasses.
- Utilize the search bar to locate drinks by name.
- Access all functionalities from the homepage.

### Application Design and Navigation

The application adheres to a consistent and intuitive design philosophy:

- The homepage provides clear links to the login and register pages.
- Login and register pages share a similar layout, differing only in their main content.
- The dashboard, encompassing profile, drinks, categories, ingredients, and glasses pages, adheres to a unified layout and design.
- Easy navigation between dashboard pages is facilitated through visible links.
- A dedicated logout button ensures a seamless user experience.

### Technology Stack
